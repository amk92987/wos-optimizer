## Hero Skill System

Each hero has two types of skills, visible on separate sides of the skill screen:

### Exploration Skills (Left Side)
- Upgraded with **Exploration Manuals**
- Used for PvE content (exploration, events)
- Levels 1-5 with equal % increase per level
- Example: If max effect is 25%, each level gives +5%

### Expedition Skills (Right Side)
- Upgraded with **Expedition Manuals**
- Used for PvP content (rallies, garrison, SvS)
- Levels 1-5 with equal % increase per level
- **Top-right skill** is specifically used when joining rallies

### Manual Costs
Increasing amount of manuals required per level upgrade (exact amounts vary by hero rarity).

---

## Rally Mechanics

### Rally Leader (Captain)
**Source:** LootBar Rally Guide, WoS Wiki Advanced Rally Guide

- Rally leader's **3 heroes** provide buffs to the entire rally
- **9 expedition skills total** (3 right-side skills per hero × 3 heroes)
- All 9 skills activate regardless of hero positioning
- The higher your hero skills, the better the buffs

### Rally Joiner (Member)
**Source:** BlueStacks Rally Joiner Guide, Century Games Help Center

**CRITICAL:** Only your **leftmost hero's TOP-RIGHT expedition skill** contributes!
- **Leftmost hero**: First hero in your march lineup (slot 1, marked with blue flag)
- **Top-right skill**: The expedition skill in top-right position on hero skill screen
- Your other 2 heroes and their skills DON'T count when joining
- Top **4 highest SKILL LEVEL** expedition skills from all joiners apply
- Member skills **CAN stack** if they are the same effect

### Joiner Skill Selection
**Source:** WoS Wiki Advanced Rally Guide

"Only the 4 highest-leveled FIRST SKILL of the Hero Captain will be selected for battle."

### Best Joiner Heroes
| Role | Hero | Top-Right Skill | Effect per Level (1-5) |
|------|------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Attack Joiner** | Jessie | Stand of Arms | +5/10/15/20/25% DMG dealt |
| **Garrison Joiner** | Sergey | Defenders' Edge | -4/8/12/16/20% DMG taken |

**Why Jessie is best for attack:** Her "damage dealt" buff affects ALL damage types including normal attacks, hero skills, pet abilities, and teammate buffs. This is superior to heroes that only boost basic auto-attack damage.

**Why Sergey is best for garrison:** Universal damage reduction is the most straightforward defensive joiner effect.

**Note:** Skill effects scale with level. A level 5 Jessie provides +25% DMG, while level 1 only provides +5%.

---

## Chief Gear

**Source:** WoS Wiki - Chief Gear, Chief Gear Upgrading & Forging

Chief Gear provides **global combat buffs** that apply to ALL heroes and troops. Unlike hero gear, Chief Gear is **always active** once equipped.

### The 6 Chief Gear Pieces

| Gear Piece | Primary Stat | Benefits | Priority |
|------------|--------------|----------|----------|
| **Ring** | Troop Attack (All) | Universal - all classes | 1 (Highest) |
| **Amulet** | Troop Lethality/Damage | Universal - PvP focused | 2 |
| **Gloves** | Marksman Attack | Marksman heroes (Alonso, Molly) | 3 |
| **Boots** | Lancer Attack | Lancer heroes | 4 |
| **Helmet** | Infantry Defense | Infantry heroes (Natalia, Sergey, Flint) | 5 |
| **Armor** | Infantry Health | Infantry heroes | 6 |

### Quality Tiers (Lowest → Highest)

1. Common → 2. Uncommon → 3. Rare → 4. Epic → 5. Legendary → 6. **Mythic**

**Long-term goal:** Mythic on Ring & Amulet first.

### Upgrade Priority (Community Consensus)

**Tier 1 - Highest Impact (Upgrade First):**
1. **Ring** - Troop Attack scales everywhere
2. **Amulet** - Lethality decisive in PvP & SvS

**Tier 2 - Offensive Class Scaling:**
3. **Gloves** - Marksman Attack
4. **Boots** - Lancer Attack

**Tier 3 - Defensive/Situational:**
5. **Helmet** - Infantry Defense
6. **Armor** - Infantry Health (useful for garrison, Crazy Joe, defensive SvS)

### Why Ring & Amulet First?

- They affect **all troops** (not just one class)
- They apply to rallies, field PvP, defense, SvS scoring
- They **stack multiplicatively** with hero expedition buffs

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong |
|---------|----------------|
| Upgrading Infantry gear first "because infantry tanks" | Infantry stats matter LESS than damage multipliers in PvP/SvS |
| Over-investing in Epic/Legendary tiers | These are temporary; Mythic is the real target |
| Ignoring Amulet lethality | Lethality directly impacts kill count & battle outcome |

## Chief Gear vs Hero Gear ROI

**ROI = Return on Investment**: For each scarce resource spent, how much combat power gained and in how many modes?

### Chief Gear ROI (HIGHEST)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Scope | Global - all troops, all heroes |
| Scaling | Multiplicative |
| Mode Coverage | 100% (rallies, PvP, garrison, events, SvS) |
| Replacement Risk | None |
| Long-term Relevance | Permanent |

**Chief Gear is "foundational power" - no condition where it's inactive.**

### Hero Gear ROI (CONDITIONAL)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Scope | Single hero only |
| Scaling | Additive + conditional |
| Mode Coverage | Limited |
| Replacement Risk | HIGH (generation-bound) |
| Long-term Relevance | Hero-dependent |

**Hero Gear ROI requires ALL THREE conditions:**
1. Hero is used often
2. Hero is used in modes where gear matters
3. Hero is NOT about to be replaced by newer generation

If ANY condition fails → ROI collapses.

### Rally Context Changes Everything

| Context | Chief Gear ROI | Hero Gear ROI |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Rally Leader | High (multiplies entire rally) | Medium (only your 3 heroes) |
| Rally Joiner | High (still applies to your troops) | **Very Low** (barely matters) |
| Field PvP | High | High |
| Arena | High | High |

**Critical insight:** For rally joiners, hero gear ROI is extremely low. Chief Gear ROI is unchanged.

### Correct Investment Hierarchy

1. **Chief Gear: Ring** (Troop Attack - universal)
2. **Chief Gear: Amulet** (Lethality - PvP decisive)
3. **Remaining Chief Gear**
4. **Hero Gear on long-term core heroes** (if conditions met)
5. **Hero Gear on situational heroes**

**Only whales can safely violate this order.**

### Before Investing in Hero Gear, Verify:

- [ ] Hero is used as rally LEADER (not just joiner)
- [ ] Hero remains relevant next generation
- [ ] Chief Ring and Amulet at target tier FIRST

---

## Spender-Level Gear Paths

**Core Principle:** Spender level determines how much inefficiency you can afford.

| Spender | Chief Gear | Hero Gear | Mistake Tolerance |
|---------|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| F2P | Mandatory | Minimal (1 hero max) | None |
| Low | Dominant | Limited (2 heroes) | Low |
| Medium | Balanced | Strategic (3-4 heroes) | Medium |
| Whale | Maxed | Everything | High |

### F2P (Free-to-Play)

**Reality:** Very limited resources. Cannot recover from mistakes quickly.

**Chief Gear:** ABSOLUTE priority
- Focus on 2-3 pieces ahead of rest
- Do NOT rush Mythic on everything
- Order: Ring → Amulet → Gloves → Boots → Helmet → Armor

**Hero Gear:** Extremely limited
- Only 1 hero (primary field damage dealer)
- Must remain relevant 2+ generations
- NEVER gear rally joiners
- Targets: Molly OR Alonso (not both)

### Low Spender (Battle Pass / small packs)

**Reality:** Steady but slow income. Still punished by major misallocations.

**Chief Gear:** Still #1 priority
- Ring + Amulet pushed ahead
- Can begin equalizing Gloves/Boots sooner

**Hero Gear:** Selective (2 heroes max)
- Must be used daily across multiple modes
- NOT purely rally joiner
- Targets: Alonso, Jeronimo (if rally leader), Molly
- AVOID: Gearing defensive heroes early

### Medium Spender

**Reality:** Can sustain upgrades. Can recover from mistakes.

**Chief Gear:** Foundational
- Ring & Amulet to Mythic early
- Rest follows closer behind

**Hero Gear:** Strategic (3-4 heroes)
- Priority: Rally leader → Primary DPS → Secondary DPS → Situational
- Targets: Jeronimo, Alonso, Molly, 1 situational

### Whale

**Reality:** Resource constraints removed. Speed > efficiency.

**Chief Gear:** Max everything fast

**Hero Gear:** All core heroes
- Can gear heroes before optimal
- Can gear heroes knowing they'll be replaced
- ROI constraints ignored

## Combat Synergy Model

**Core Question:** Where does my power actually come from in this fight?

### Synergy Weights by Context (★ = importance, max 5)

#### Rally Leader
| Component | Weight | Why |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Chief Gear | ★★★★★ | Full global multiplier |
| Leader Hero Selection | ★★★★★ | 9 skills define rally |
| Leader Hero Gear | ★★★☆☆ | Affects skill scaling |
| Joiner Hero Gear | ☆☆☆☆☆ | Irrelevant |

**Key:** Rally leaders chosen for EXPEDITION SKILL QUALITY, not DPS.

#### Rally Joiner
| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Chief Gear | ★★★★★ |
| First Hero Skill | ★★★★☆ |
| Hero Gear | ★☆☆☆☆ |

**Key:** Joiners are SKILL CARRIERS, not damage dealers.

#### Field PvP
| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Hero Gear | ★★★★★ |
| Hero DPS kit | ★★★★★ |
| Chief Gear | ★★★☆☆ |

**Key:** ONLY mode where hero gear rivals chief gear ROI.

#### Garrison
| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Damage reduction skills | ★★★★★ |
| Chief Gear (defensive) | ★★★★☆ |
| Hero Gear | ★★☆☆☆ |
| DPS | ★☆☆☆☆ |

### Hero Role Tags

| Hero | Roles |
|------|-------|
| Jeronimo | rally_leader, attack_buffer |
| Jessie | attack_joiner |
| Sergey | defense_joiner, garrison |
| Molly | field_dps, solo |
| Alonso | field_dps, hybrid |
| Natalia | tank, garrison, rally_leader |

### Never Recommend

- DPS heroes as joiners (waste of slot)
- Defensive heroes as rally leaders
- Gearing joiner-only heroes

### Power Illusion Warning

> **Hero gear increases visible damage numbers.**
> **Chief gear increases battle outcomes.**

Warn users when they:
- Over-invest in hero gear
- Gear joiners
- Ignore Ring/Amulet progression

### Core Truths

1. Rallies are won by **buffs**, not DPS
2. Joiners carry **skills**, not damage
3. Chief Gear is **universal** power
4. Hero Gear is **situational** power
5. Spender level determines allowed inefficiency

## Troop Ratios

**Source:** A Jack Of Everything Guide

### Combat Order
Infantry fights first → Lancers → Marksmen

### Class Counters
- Infantry beats Lancer
- Lancer beats Marksman
- Marksman beats Infantry

### Recommended Ratios by Activity

| Activity | Infantry | Lancer | Marksman | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Default Formation** | 50% | 20% | 30% | Balanced for most content |
| **Castle Battle** | 50% | 20% | 30% | Standard PvP |
| **Bear Hunt** | 0% | 10% | 90% | Maximum DPS |
| **Crazy Joe** | 90% | 10% | 0% | Infantry kills before others engage |
| **Labyrinth** | 60% | 15% | 25% | Tanky for PvE |
| **Alliance Championship** | 45% | 25% | 35% | Balanced competitive |

### Strategy Notes
- Analyze battle reports to check if infantry survives
- If infantry dies too fast, increase infantry %
- If carrying excess troops, reduce infantry %
- For fast battles (Crazy Joe), back row may never engage

## Hero Tier Rankings

**Source:** One Chilled Gamer Expedition Tier List

### By Role

#### Rally Joining (Most Critical)
Top performers: **Jessie**, **Jeronimo**
- Their 1st Expedition Skill provides strong rally buffs

#### Rally Leading
Use your **3 strongest heroes** (one per class)
- Latest generation heroes typically perform best
- Jeronimo remains optimal through Gen 3 for P2P players

#### Defending
Heroes with durability-enhancing skills:
- Walis Bokan
- Ling Xue
- Sergey

#### Beast Hunting
**Gina** is the premier choice

### Generation Power Ranking
Latest generations (7-9) automatically rank highest due to superior stats and abilities.

**Gen 1 heroes that remain valuable:**
- Jeronimo (rally leading)
- Natalia (tank)
- Jessie (attack joiner)
- Sergey (garrison joiner)

---

## Event Strategies

### Crazy Joe
**Source:** One Chilled Gamer Crazy Joe Guide

**Troop Ratio:** 90% Infantry / 10% Lancer / 0% Marksman

**Why Infantry?**
Infantry engage first. If their stats are high enough, they defeat all bandits before Lancers or Marksmen have a chance to attack.

**Scoring:**
- 20 waves total
- Waves 7, 14, 17: Online players only, ~2x points
- Waves 10, 20: Alliance HQ only
- 2 losses = elimination

**Tips:**
- Coordinate troop exchanges with allies
- Stay online during high-value waves
- Send Infantry when reinforcing for maximum kill participation
- Don't heal during event (reduces reinforcer opportunities)

### Bear Hunt
**Troop Ratio:** 0% Infantry / 10% Lancer / 90% Marksman

Maximum damage output since Bear doesn't kill your troops quickly.

### Castle Battle
**Troop Ratio:** 50% Infantry / 20% Lancer / 30% Marksman

Standard balanced PvP composition.

## Common Misconceptions

**Source:** Century Games Help Center, BlueStacks

### ❌ "All joiner skills apply with reduced effect"
**✅ TRUTH:** Only your first hero's TOP-RIGHT skill contributes. Other skills don't apply at all.

### ❌ "Joiner hero gear matters a lot"
**✅ TRUTH:** For joining rallies, only the first hero's single skill matters. Gear/chief buffs have minimal impact on join contribution.

### ❌ "Damage taken reduced" = "Enemy damage reduced"
**✅ TRUTH:** These are different subjects calculated differently. Stacking isn't simple addition.

| **data** | Verified database entries (skills/stats) | Strongest |
| **context** | Event/mode logic (SvS vs Bear vs CJ) | Strong |
| **economy** | Spender constraints (F2P vs whale) | Strong |
| **meta** | Community consensus (version-sensitive) | Weaker |
| **personalized** | User-specific inputs (their heroes/gear) | Strong |

### Confidence Grades

| Grade | Score | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| A | 85%+ | Mechanics-backed + verified data |
| B | 70-84% | Strong evidence, minor assumptions |
| C | 50-69% | Some assumptions or meta-based |
| D | <50% | Speculative or user-dependent |

### Two-Level UX

**Level 1 (Short):** One sentence for casual users
> "Jessie is best because rally joiners only apply one top-right skill, and hers boosts all-troops damage."

**Level 2 (Expandable):** Full breakdown for power users
- Mechanic explanation
- Skill evidence
- Tradeoffs
- What to do next
- Scoring breakdown

### Core Claims (Evidence-Backed)

| Claim ID | Claim | Type |
|----------|-------|------|
| `claim_joiner_top_right_only` | Rally joiners only contribute the first hero's top-right expedition skill | mechanic |
| `claim_leader_9_skills` | Rally leaders provide 9 expedition skills (3 heroes x 3 skills each) | mechanic |
| `claim_top_4_joiner_skills` | Top 4 highest level expedition skills from all joiners are applied | mechanic |
| `claim_jessie_dmg_boost` | Jessie's top-right skill gives +5/10/15/20/25% DMG dealt per level | data |
| `claim_sergey_dmg_reduction` | Sergey's top-right skill gives -4/8/12/16/20% DMG taken per level | data |
| `claim_chief_gear_global` | Chief Gear provides global buffs in ALL combat modes | mechanic |
| `claim_hero_gear_personal` | Hero Gear only affects the individual hero equipped | mechanic |
| `claim_joiner_gear_low_roi` | Hero gear on rally joiners has minimal impact (skills matter, not damage) | economy |
| `claim_dps_personal_not_rally` | DPS is personal damage; rally outcomes scale with buffs | mechanic |

### Example Explanations

#### Jessie as Attack Joiner
- **Why:** Joiner uses only top-right skill; Jessie's buffs all-troops damage
- **Do:** Jessie in slot #1, level her top-right skill
- **Don't:** Sink hero gear into Jessie unless she's also field PvP core

#### Sergey as Defense Joiner
- **Why:** Joiner top-right skill; Sergey provides universal damage reduction
- **Do:** Sergey in slot #1 when joining defense/garrison rallies

#### Jeronimo as Rally Leader
- **Why:** Leader uses 9 skills; Jeronimo has multiple all-troops offensive effects
- **Do:** Prioritize as rally lead; Chief Gear first, then consider Jeronimo hero gear

#### Molly for Field, Not Rally
- **Why:** DPS is personal damage; rallies scale with buffs, not individual damage
- **Do:** Gear Molly for field/solo PvP only; don't expect rally improvement

#### Chief Gear Priority
- **Why:** Global multiplier applies everywhere
- **Do:** Ring → Amulet → Gloves/Boots to Mythic
