## Rally Mechanics

### Rally Leader (Captain)
**Source:** LootBar Rally Guide, WoS Wiki Advanced Rally Guide

- Rally leader's **3 heroes** provide buffs to the entire rally
- **9 expedition skills total** (3 right-side skills per hero × 3 heroes)
- All 9 skills activate regardless of hero positioning
- The higher your hero skills, the better the buffs

### Rally Joiner (Member)
**Source:** BlueStacks Rally Joiner Guide, Century Games Help Center

**CRITICAL:** Only your **first hero's TOP-RIGHT expedition skill** contributes!
- Your other 2 heroes and their skills DON'T count when joining
- Up to **4 member skills** contribute total to a rally
- Member skills **CAN stack** if they are the same effect
- The first hero is marked with a blue flag icon

### Joiner Skill Selection
**Source:** WoS Wiki Advanced Rally Guide

"Only the 4 highest-leveled FIRST SKILL of the Hero Captain will be selected for battle."

### Best Joiner Heroes
| Role | Hero | Top-Right Skill | Effect |
|------|------|-----------------|--------|
| **Attack Joiner** | Jessie | Stand of Arms | +25% damage dealt (all troops) |
| **Garrison Joiner** | Sergey | Defenders' Edge | -20% damage taken (all troops) |

**Why Jessie is best for attack:** Her "damage dealt" buff affects ALL damage types including normal attacks, hero skills, pet abilities, and teammate buffs. This is superior to heroes that only boost basic auto-attack damage.

**Why Sergey is best for garrison:** Universal damage reduction is the most straightforward defensive joiner effect.

## Troop Ratios

**Source:** A Jack Of Everything Guide

### Combat Order
Infantry fights first → Lancers → Marksmen

### Class Counters
- Infantry beats Lancer
- Lancer beats Marksman
- Marksman beats Infantry

### Recommended Ratios by Activity

| Activity | Infantry | Lancer | Marksman | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Default Formation** | 50% | 20% | 30% | Balanced for most content |
| **Castle Battle** | 50% | 20% | 30% | Standard PvP |
| **Bear Hunt** | 0% | 10% | 90% | Maximum DPS |
| **Crazy Joe** | 90% | 10% | 0% | Infantry kills before others engage |
| **Labyrinth** | 60% | 15% | 25% | Tanky for PvE |
| **Alliance Championship** | 45% | 25% | 35% | Balanced competitive |

### Strategy Notes
- Analyze battle reports to check if infantry survives
- If infantry dies too fast, increase infantry %
- If carrying excess troops, reduce infantry %
- For fast battles (Crazy Joe), back row may never engage

## Event Strategies

### Crazy Joe
**Source:** One Chilled Gamer Crazy Joe Guide

**Troop Ratio:** 90% Infantry / 10% Lancer / 0% Marksman

**Why Infantry?**
Infantry engage first. If their stats are high enough, they defeat all bandits before Lancers or Marksmen have a chance to attack.

**Scoring:**
- 20 waves total
- Waves 7, 14, 17: Online players only, ~2x points
- Waves 10, 20: Alliance HQ only
- 2 losses = elimination

**Tips:**
- Coordinate troop exchanges with allies
- Stay online during high-value waves
- Send Infantry when reinforcing for maximum kill participation
- Don't heal during event (reduces reinforcer opportunities)

### Bear Hunt
**Troop Ratio:** 0% Infantry / 10% Lancer / 90% Marksman

Maximum damage output since Bear doesn't kill your troops quickly.

### Castle Battle
**Troop Ratio:** 50% Infantry / 20% Lancer / 30% Marksman

Standard balanced PvP composition.

## Common Misconceptions

**Source:** Century Games Help Center, BlueStacks

### ❌ "All joiner skills apply with reduced effect"
**✅ TRUTH:** Only your first hero's TOP-RIGHT skill contributes. Other skills don't apply at all.

### ❌ "Joiner hero gear matters a lot"
**✅ TRUTH:** For joining rallies, only the first hero's single skill matters. Gear/chief buffs have minimal impact on join contribution.

### ❌ "Damage taken reduced" = "Enemy damage reduced"
**✅ TRUTH:** These are different subjects calculated differently. Stacking isn't simple addition.
