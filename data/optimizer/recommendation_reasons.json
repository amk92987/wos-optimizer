    "furnace": {
      "short": "Unlocks all other systems",
      "detailed": "Furnace level gates everything else in the game. Higher Furnace unlocks new buildings, higher troop tiers, and eventually Fire Crystal content at L30.",
      "priority_by_phase": {
        "early_game": "Critical - rush to L19 for Daybreak Island",
        "mid_game": "Critical - rush to L30 for FC unlock",
        "late_game": "High - FC progression unlocks higher tiers",
        "endgame": "Medium - diminishing returns after FC5"
      }
    },
    "war_academy": {
      "short": "Massive troop training efficiency",
      "detailed": "War Academy reduces troop training time and cost. At high levels, you train the same troops in half the time with fewer resources. Essential for rebuilding after SvS losses.",
      "priority_by_phase": {
        "late_game": "Critical - first FC investment after Furnace",
        "endgame": "High - max efficiency at FC10"
      },
      "spending_notes": {
        "f2p": "Focus here - training efficiency compounds over time",
        "whale": "Still important but speedups reduce urgency"
      }
    },
    "troops_train": {
      "short": "Direct power increase",
      "detailed": "Higher tier troops have better stats. T10+ troops significantly outperform lower tiers in combat. Training more troops = more power = better SvS performance.",
      "priority_by_phase": {
        "early_game": "Medium - limited by Furnace level",
        "mid_game": "High - T8-T9 are solid",
        "late_game": "Critical - T10 is the power tier",
        "endgame": "Critical - T11 dominates"
      }
    },
    "troops_promote": {
      "short": "Convert existing troops to higher tier",
      "detailed": "Promotion converts lower tier troops to higher tier without full training cost. More efficient than training from scratch when you have excess lower-tier troops.",

    "hero_gear_mastery": {
      "short": "Combat stat multiplier",

    "chief_gear": {
      "short": "Passive stat bonuses",
      "detailed": "Chief Gear provides always-on stat bonuses. Higher tiers give more stats but cost significantly more. Red-1 is a good stopping point for non-whales.",

    "chief_charms": {
      "short": "Additional stat layer",
      "detailed": "Charms provide independent stat bonuses across 6 slots. L1-11 are accessible to everyone. L12-16 require Gen 7 state and Jewel Secrets.",
      "priority_by_phase": {
        "mid_game": "High - push all slots to L11",
        "late_game": "Medium - wait for Gen 7 for L12+",

    "pets": {
      "short": "Combat skills + passive bonuses",
      "detailed": "Pets provide active combat skills (2-hour buffs) and passive stat bonuses. SSR pets have the best skills and highest level cap (100). Focus SSR pets first.",
      "priority_by_phase": {
        "mid_game": "Medium - start collection early",

      "short": "Combat buffs via Life Essence",
