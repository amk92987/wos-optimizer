    "question": "Be completely honest: What do you ACTUALLY know with certainty about Jessie's expedition skills in WoS? If you don't know specific percentages or exact skill names, say so. What makes players consider her a good rally joiner?",
    "answer": "I don't have verified information on the specific percentages or exact skill names for Jessie's expedition skills in Whiteout Survival. However, players might consider Jessie a good rally joiner due to her potential synergies or abilities that enhance the effectiveness of a rally, possibly through buffs or debuffs that benefit the rally leader's strategy. Without specific details, I can't provide more precise reasons."

    "question": "Be completely honest: What do you ACTUALLY know with certainty about Jeronimo's role in WoS? Why do some guides recommend him as rally leader? What are the actual known facts about his skills?",
    "answer": "I don't have verified information on the specific details of Jeronimo's skills or why some guides recommend him as a rally leader. However, I can confirm that Jeronimo is a Gen 1 hero in Whiteout Survival. In general, a hero recommended as a rally leader might possess skills or attributes that enhance the effectiveness of the rally, but without specific details, I can't provide more information."

    "question": "For troop ratios in WoS, what is actually KNOWN versus what is speculation?\n- What's the general consensus on attack ratios?\n- What's the logic behind having more Infantry vs more Marksman?\n- Are there official sources or is this all player-derived?",
    "answer": "I don't have verified information on specific troop ratios in Whiteout Survival. However, I can provide some general insights based on common strategies in similar games, which may or may not apply directly to WoS:\n\n1. **General Consensus on Attack Ratios**: In many strategy games, players often aim for a balanced approach, with a slight emphasis on Infantry for their defensive capabilities. This is because Infantry typically absorb more damage, protecting the more vulnerable Lancers and Marksmen.\n\n2. **Logic Behind More Infantry vs More Marksman**: Infantry units are generally used to shield the more fragile but higher-damage-dealing units like Marksmen. By having more Infantry, you can sustain your frontline longer, allowing your Marksmen to deal damage over time without being quickly eliminated.\n\n3. **Sources**: Most of the information regarding troop ratios and strategies tends to be player-derived, based on personal experience and community discussions. Official sources from game developers often don't provide detailed strategies, leaving players to experiment and share their findings.\n\nFor precise strategies and ratios, it's best to engage with the WoS community or look for guides created by experienced players."

    "answer": "1. I don't have verified information on the best Infantry hero for early-mid game.\n2. I don't have verified information on the best Marksman for damage.\n3. I don't have verified information on the best Lancer for support/healing.\n4. I don't have verified information on which hero type is most gear-dependent."

    "question": "What should a medium spender on a Gen 4 server (day 200-280) prioritize? Only provide advice you're confident about. Acknowledge uncertainty where it exists.",
    "answer": "For a medium spender on a Gen 4 server (day 200-280), here are some priorities you might consider:\n\n1. **Hero Development**: Focus on developing Gen 4 heroes like Ahmose, Reina, and Lynn. These heroes are current for your server generation and will likely provide the most benefit in both PvP and PvE scenarios.\n\n2. **Hero Skills**: Invest in upgrading the skills of your heroes, especially focusing on those that are most effective in the lead hero position for expedition skills, as these apply full effects.\n\n3. **Gear and Equipment**: Prioritize upgrading and enhancing gear for your heroes. This can significantly boost their effectiveness in battles.\n\n4. **Resource Management**: Ensure you are efficiently managing resources to support hero upgrades and building enhancements. This includes balancing spending on resources like food, wood, and stone.\n\n5. **Participation in Events**: Engage in server events that offer valuable rewards. These can provide resources, hero shards, and other items that can accelerate your progress.\n\n6. **Alliance Involvement**: Being active in a strong alliance can provide additional benefits such as rally participation, alliance gifts, and support in events.\n\n7. **Rallies and Marches**: Optimize your world marches by selecting the best heroes for each class (Infantry, Lancer, Marksman) and participate in rallies to maximize your gains from group activities.\n\n8. **Arena and PvP**: Develop a strong team of 5 heroes for the arena, as this can be a significant source of rewards and prestige.\n\nI don't have verified information on the exact skill effects or optimal hero synergies, so I recommend experimenting with different combinations to find what works best for your playstyle."
