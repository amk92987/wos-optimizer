He is your top DPS hero for field combat and is crucial for rallies.\n  \n2. **Jessie (A)** - Upgrade her skills for rally joining. She's essential for maximizing damage dealt in rallies.\n\n3. **Philly (A)** - He can serve as a field DPS hero but invest less compared to Jeronimo.\n\n4. **Sergey (B)** - Keep his skills upgraded for garrison defense, but do not invest in gear.\n\n5. **Gordon (S)** - If you have resources left, you can invest in him later since he has good potential.\n\nPrioritize chief gear to the same tier first, then focus on Jeronimo's hero gear after your chief gear is set. Avoid spreading resources too thin across many heroes.",

    "response": "Chief, slot 1 matters for rally joining because only the top-right expedition skill of the joiner hero impacts the rally's performance. For your rallies, having Jessie in slot 1 maximizes damage output, as her skill grants a +25% damage increase. Other heroes in different slots do not contribute to this effect.
