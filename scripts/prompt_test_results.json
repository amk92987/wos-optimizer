Gear Sergey (Garrison joiner) only if you want to optimize for defense.\n3. Consider Gordon next for field DPS, but ensure you have the necessary chief gear first for universal benefits.\n\nRemember, chief gear always comes first, and gear for rally joiners is less critical. Prioritize your strongest field DPS heroes!",

    "response": "Chief, exploration skills enhance your hero's performance in PvE scenarios, such as gathering resources and defeating enemy bases. Expedition skills improve your hero's effectiveness in rallying and garrisoning, affecting troop damage dealt or damage taken during battles.\n\nFor your heroes:\n- Jeronimo, Natalia, and Sergey have exploration skills that aid in PvE.\n- Jessie and Gordon have expedition skills that boost their effectiveness in rallies and garrisons.\n\nFocus on maximizing expedition skills for rallying and garrisoning to excel in your SvS priorities.",

    "response": "Slot 1 matters for rally joining because only the top-right expedition skill of the hero in slot 1 is activated during rallies. This means that if you want to maximize damage dealt in a rally, you should prioritize heroes like Jessie, who provides a +25% damage boost. The skills of joiner heroes in other slots are irrelevant for rally effectiveness.",
