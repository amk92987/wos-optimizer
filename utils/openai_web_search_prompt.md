I'm building a Whiteout Survival (WoS) optimizer app and need VERIFIED, current information. Please search the web for accurate answers to these questions. Cite your sources where possible.

## 1. HERO SKILL SPECIFICS

Search for the actual expedition skill effects for these key heroes:
- **Jeronimo**: What does his expedition skill actually do? Why is he recommended as rally leader?
- **Jessie**: What are her expedition skills? Why is she considered the best attack/rally joiner?
- **Sergey**: What are his expedition skills? Why is he best for garrison joining?
- **Natalia**: What makes her the top tank? What do her skills provide?

## 2. TROOP RATIOS - VERIFIED SOURCES

Search for current meta troop ratios from reliable WoS guides/communities:
- Default attack composition (Infantry/Lancer/Marksman %)
- Castle defense/garrison composition
- Bear Trap rally (leader vs joiner)
- Crazy Joe rally
- Field PvP/SvS

Are these percentages consistent across sources or do they vary?

## 3. HERO TIER LIST - CURRENT META

Search for current (2024-2025) hero tier lists:
- Who are the current S+ tier heroes for PvP/SvS?
- Who are the best heroes by class (Infantry, Lancer, Marksman)?
- Which Gen 1-3 heroes are still meta-relevant on older servers?
- Which heroes are "trap" investments (look good but aren't worth it)?

## 4. MYTHIC GEAR PRIORITY

Search for mythic gear priority recommendations:
- Which hero should get mythic gear first?
- What's the recommended order for: Natalia, Alonso, Jeronimo, Molly, Flint?
- Does the priority change based on spender level (F2P vs whale)?

## 5. RALLY MECHANICS

Verify these rally mechanics:
- Rally leader's expedition skills apply at full effect to entire rally - TRUE or FALSE?
- Joiner's expedition skills have reduced effect - TRUE or FALSE?
- What's the actual reduction percentage for joiners?
- Are there specific "joiner heroes" whose skills are designed for joining?

## 6. GENERATION PROGRESSION & POWER CREEP

Search for information on:
- Which early heroes (Gen 1-3) remain relevant in Gen 7+ servers?
- Which heroes get power-crept the hardest?
- S3 transition - what changes? Which investments carry over?

## 7. PETS & HERO SYNERGIES

Search for:
- Do specific pets synergize with specific heroes?
- Are there pet + hero combinations that are particularly strong?
- Pet priority for different game modes

## 8. SPENDER-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

Search for guides specific to:
- F2P optimal hero focus
- Low spender ($5-50/month) priorities
- Medium spender priorities
- Heavy spender/whale strategies

## 9. ANY CORRECTIONS TO COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS

Search for common WoS mistakes or misconceptions that guides warn about.
